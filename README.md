# LED Stripe english version

This project is a simple IoT example.

Requirements:

Hardware:
* Node MCU esp8266
* WS2812B LED stripe

App:
* Google Flutter
* Firebase database

Flutter required plugins:
* firebase_database
* flutter_colorpicker (https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_colorpicker)

For testing and simulating you can use Android Studio and its emulator or just connect your phone to the computer via the USB port and run your flutter code.
Unfortunately the app has been developed for a phone approximately 6.2” big. You may need to change the size of the boxes, and buttons so it fits on your phone screen. I am working on the solution of that don’t worry.
